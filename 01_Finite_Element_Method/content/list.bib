    abstract    = {Because of mathematical difficulties which make the solution of differential equations of the theory of elasticity impossible in many cases, the author has been impelled to seek some other method of approach than one of pure mathematical analysis. The method outlined in this paper is of this character and may with some qualifications be applied to problems of two-dimensional stress, bending of plates, bending of cylindrical shells, the general case of three-dimensional stress, and a great variety of others. Essentially, the method consists in replacing the continuous material of the elastic body being studied by a framework of bars arranged according to a definite pattern, the elements of which are endowed with elastic properties suitable to the type of problem. This framework is then analyzed, according to the procedure outlined in the paper for various types of elastic problems. Examples of the application of the principles involved are also given.},

    abstract    = {Abstract The patch test is shown to be contained in the variational formulations of the finite element methods at the assembling level, all of which require the vanishing of the virtual work of interface connection loads. By a systematic introduction of stress generating functions, attention is drawn to the fact that any given finite element model can be assembled in two different ways: either by identification of a set of boundary displacements (leading to the direct stiffness method), or by identification of a set of local stress function values (leading to the dual direct flexibility method). Looking at any conjugate couple (generalized displacement-generalized surface traction) at an interface, one is strongly transmitted, the other weakly. Discretization of the zero virtual work condition at an interface of plate bending models, by means of Legendre polynomial expansions, allows a systematic construction of so-called ‘non-conforming’ elements that pass the patch test. They are in fact identified with weakly conforming, but strongly diffusive, hybrids, and the lowest degree element (quadratic) is in fact the Morley constant-moment element. Examples are given for higher degree displacement fields. The case of plate stretching elements can be handled by duality, the difficulties being here associated with the requirements for diffusivity. Non-diffusive elements that pass the zero interface virtual work test can be constructed systematically and are identifiable with weakly diffusive, but strongly conforming, hybrids of the type first proposed by T. H. H. Pian.},

    abstract    = {Abstract A displacement method of matrix analysis for local instability of plates, stiffened panels and thin-walled columns is presented. The analysis is applicable to stiffened panel and columns for which the cross-section is made up of thin flat plates. For these cases it may be assumed that during buckling deformation no flat component of the cross-section is translated in its own plane and the edge lines at the junctions between flats remain fixed in space. The analysis leads to the standard eigenvalue equation from which the buckling stress can be determined. The elastic and geometrical stiffness matrices derived for this analysis depend on the wavelength of the buckled pattern and this dependence is of a simple form since all coefficients in the resulting stiffness matrices contain the buckling wavelength only as a common factor allowing for considerable simplification in any numerical computations. With this new formulation of local instability analysis very few elements are required to obtain high accuracy for the buckling stress. Several examples illustrating typical applications of this new method have been included.},

Use of these moduli is essential in order to preserve the asymptotic rate of quadratic convergence of Newton methods. The accuracy of the algorithm is assessed by means of iso-error maps. The excellent performance of the algorithm for large time steps is illustrated in numerical experiments.},
